# Cardputer Doomsday game

Simple game for the M5Stack Cardputer. Guess what day of the week an arbitrary date will fall on. It's quite easy to work out what day of the week any given date will fall on, and I find it really fun to do so.

If you would like to learn how to work it out for yourself you should check out the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule). The algorithm was originally conceived by [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway). An incredible mathematician and a personal hero of mine.
